            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer science student at USTHB, specializing in information systems and software engineering.
                I'm learning to design and build both applications and websites that aim to make life smoother and more
                efficient. I love the challenge of solving complex problems and seeing my code come to life. Fluent in
                both French and English, I’m able to communicate clearly and collaborate in a variety of environments.
                My focus is on clean code, thoughtful design, and building solutions that truly make a difference.

            <strong>Import Guarantees Management – Desktop App</strong><br>
            A desktop application developed using WPF and C#, designed to manage international import guarantees for the National Bank of Algeria. The application includes several advanced features:
            <ul>
                <li>User creation and role-based permission transfer, allowing the department head to delegate tasks to other users.</li>
                <li>Template creation to avoid rewriting standard documents repeatedly.</li>
                <li>Multilingual support, enabling communication with foreign banks through built-in translation tools.</li>
                <li>Automatic field filling for recurring guarantee data.</li>
                <li>Automatic commission calculations based on entered financial data.</li>
                <li>An integrated chat system allowing employees to communicate without needing to move between offices.</li>
                <li>A notification system that alerts users when a guarantee is about to expire.</li>
            </ul>
            This project was part of a final-year academic collaboration and aimed at digitalizing and optimizing the workflow of guarantee processing.
